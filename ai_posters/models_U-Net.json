The network is based on a fully convolutional neural network whose architecture was modified and extended to work with fewer training images and to yield more precise segmentation. Segmentation of a 512\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0512 image takes less than a second on a modern (2015) GPU using the U-Net architecture.",
