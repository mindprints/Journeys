It functioned as a research and development facility for the Bell System and later Bell Labs between 1962 and 2007. The centerpiece of the campus, a modernist structure designed by Eero Saarinen, was dubbed \"the biggest mirror ever\" for its mirrored exterior. Roche-Dinkeloo, the successor firm to Saarinen's architectural practice, designed two expansions to the original structure.",
