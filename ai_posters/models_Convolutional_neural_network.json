This type of deep learning network has been applied to process and make predictions from many different types of data including text, images and audio. CNNs are the de-facto standard in deep learning-based approaches to computer vision and image processing, and have only recently been replaced\u2014in some cases\u2014by newer deep learning architectures such as the transformer.",
