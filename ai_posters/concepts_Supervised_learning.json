    "text": "In machine learning, supervised learning (SL) is a type of machine learning paradigm where an algorithm learns to map input data to a specific output based on example input-output pairs. This process involves training a statistical model using labeled data, meaning each piece of input data is provided with the correct output. For instance, if you want a model to identify cats in images, supervised learning would involve feeding it many images of cats (inputs) that are explicitly labeled \"cat\" (outputs).",
