    "text": "In philosophy, a thick concept is a kind of concept that both has a significant degree of descriptive content and is evaluatively loaded. Paradigmatic examples are various virtues and vices such as courage, cruelty, truthfulness and kindness. Courage for example, may be given a rough characterization in descriptive terms as '...opposing danger to promote a valued end'. At the same time, characterizing someone as courageous typically involves expressing an attitude of esteem or a \"pro-attitude\", or a good-making quality \u2013 i.e. an evaluative statement.",
