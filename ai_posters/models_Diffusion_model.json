    "text": "In machine learning, diffusion models, also known as diffusion-based generative models or score-based generative models, are a class of latent variable generative models. A diffusion model consists of two major components: the forward diffusion process, and the reverse sampling process. The goal of diffusion models is to learn a diffusion process for a given dataset, such that the process can generate new elements that are distributed similarly as the original dataset. A diffusion model models data as generated by a diffusion process, whereby a new datum performs a random walk with drift through the space of all possible data. A trained diffusion model can be sampled in many ways, with different efficiency and quality.",
